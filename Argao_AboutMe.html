              <p>Hello, my name is Jason Argao, and I am currently a student at Dublin High School, graduating in the year 2021. As for the pandemic that occurred during the 2019-20 year, I have been forced to adapt to the online learning environment for the foruth quarter of that year. A couple of notable courses that I'm taking this school year include Trigonometry, Video Game Art/Design, and Computer Science Prinicples (CSP). When it comes to CSP, it's pretty much the only engineering-related course I have ever took in my high school career. I've always been interested in learning skills like coding in general but never learned any of that until I started taking this course. As mentioned in my <a href="Argao_Resume.html">resume,</a>I've learned the following programming languages through the CSP course: HTML, CSS, and Python. In addition, I also partook in several <a href="Argao_Projects.html">projects</a> including programming through Scratch, and the MIT App Inventor. Regarding about what I want to do after I gradutate high school, my future/plans are uncertain. But I am confident that I'll figure it out when the time comes. In the meantime feel free to explore my portfolio or <a href="Argao_ContactMe.html">contact me</a> if needed. Thanks for reading, and enjoy my portfolio!</p>
