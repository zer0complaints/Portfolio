                <p>Working with a partner on this project, we had to brainstorm different ideas for what to make out of the programming website, Scratch. We were free to code anything as long as the project ultimately met the criteria given from the beginning. In this scenario, we made a story that includes a few minigames in between scenes in order to have some user interaction. The story is about a group of animals finding their missing friend after they are given their friend's whereabouts. However, the minigames part never made it to the final product, because I was the one who removed it before the gallery walk. But besides that, my partner and I would both be responsible for programming and communicating with each other outside of class. Considering this is the first project of the CSP course, personally I re-learned how to use Scratch (something I haven't done since middle school), how important communication is and I got my first taste on what programming games/stories feel like in a sense.

                <p>Working with a partner, we used both the MIT App Inventor website and app through a given Andorid tablet to create a working mobile game. Our selected game had to be based off of one out of the many tutorials we looked at in the App Inventor website. With that knowledge, we created the game dubbed "Space Invaders" in which the player controls a rocket and tries to repeatedly hit the flying saucer that's on the opposite side of the player. Me and my partner both were responsible for programming and constantly testing the app, but because we couldn't figure out how to share the program with each other, I was mainly the one responsible for having the application. This project was more complicated than the previous project listed, mainly because we hit tons and tons of obstacles, even tiny details like the inability to rapid-fire bullets. But personally looking back at it, I learned how much teamwork is needed in a project like this, and how much it's going to take to fix even the simplest of errors, no matter how many times it happens.
